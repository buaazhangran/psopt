== Correction to installation instructions under Ubuntu Linux ==

In page 49 of the PSOPT Release 3 User Manual, the two lines:

$ sudo cp /adolc base/lib64/* /usr/lib
$ sudo cp -r /adolc base/include/* /usr/include/

should be:

$ sudo cp ~/adolc base/lib64/* /usr/lib
$ sudo cp -r ~/adolc base/include/* /usr/include/

As ADOL-C is installed in the home directory.


== PSOPT Release 3 Patch 01 ==

=== Description ===


This patch fixes a problem with the smooth_sign() function which prevents
the "Coulomb" example to link successfully.

The patch can be downloaded from:

http://psopt.googlecode.com/files/patch_3.01.tgz


Date of Release of this patch: 29 July 2011


=== Applying the patch ===



This is a simple procedure.

1) Extract the contents of the archive patch_2.01.tgz. This will create
   a directory ./patch_3.01

2) Copy the the file "./patch_3.01/psopt.cxx"  
    into the directory 
   <BASEDIR>/Psopt3/PSOPT/src, replacing the original files 
   "psopt.cxx" located in that directory, where <BASEDIR> is the directory
   where the original source distribution of PSOPT was extracted.

3) Depending on your operating system, do
     a) From Ubuntu Linux:
	- Open a terminal and cd to the directory <BASEDIR>/psopt3/PSOPT/lib
        - Enter the command  
                  $ make

     b) From Microsoft Windows:
	- Open a MS Visual Studio command prompt and cd to the directory
          <BASEDIR>\Psopt3\PSOPT\lib
        - Enter the command
                  > nmake -f Makefile.vc all
